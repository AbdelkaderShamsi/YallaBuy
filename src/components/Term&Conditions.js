          <h4>Accounts and Membership</h4>
          <p>
            If you create an account on the Website, you are responsible for
            maintaining the security of your account and you are fully
            responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any
            other actions taken in connection with it. We may, but have no
            obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before you may sign
            in and use our Services. Providing false contact information of any
            kind may result in the termination of your account. You must
            immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or
            any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts
            or omissions by You, including any damages of any kind incurred as a
            result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete
            your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have
            violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or
            content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we
            delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not
            re-register for our Services. We may block your email address and
            Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.

          <h4>Billing and Payments</h4>
          <p>
            You shall pay all fees or charges to your account in accordance with
            the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or
            charge is due and payable. Sensitive and private data exchange
            between the Website and its Users happens over an SSL secured
            communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital
            signatures. If in our judgment, your purchase constitutes a
            high-risk transaction, we will require you to provide us with a copy
            of your valid government-issued photo identification, and possibly a
            copy of a recent bank statement for the credit or debit card used
            for the purchase. We reserve the right to change products and
            product pricing at any time. We also reserve the right to refuse any
            order you place with us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or
            cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order.
            These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same
            customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the
            same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a
            change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by
            contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number provided
            at the time the order was made.

            typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions that may relate to
