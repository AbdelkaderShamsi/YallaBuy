            This privacy policy (“Policy”) describes how Abu Auf (“YallaBuy”,
            “we”, “us” or “our”) collects, protects and uses the personally
            identifiable information (“Personal Information”) you (“User”, “you”
            or “your”) may provide on the yallabuy.com website and any of its
            products or services (collectively, “Website” or “Services”). It
            also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of
            your Personal Information and how you can access and update this
            information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of

          <h4>Automatic Collection of Information</h4>
          <p>
            When you visit the Website our servers automatically record
            information that your browser sends. This data may include
            information such as your device’s IP address, browser type and
            version, operating system type and version, language preferences or
            the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Website, pages
            of our Website that you visit, the time spent on those pages,
            information you search for on our Website, access times and dates,
            and other statistics.

          <h4>Collection of Personal Information</h4>
          <p>
            You can visit the Website without telling us who you are or
            revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a
            specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some
            of the Website’s features, you will be asked to provide certain
            Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We
            receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when
            you create an account, make a purchase, or fill any online forms on
            the Website. When required, this information may include your email
            address, name, phone number, address, or other Personal Information.
            You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but
            then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Website’s
            features. Users who are uncertain about what information is
            mandatory are welcome to contact us.

          <h4>Managing Personal Information</h4>
          <p>
            You are able to access, add to, update and delete certain Personal
            Information about you. The information you can view, update, and
            delete may change as the Website or Services change. When you update
            information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised
            information in our records. Some information may remain in our
            private records after your deletion of such information from your
            account. We will retain and use your Personal Information for the
            period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
            disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention
            period is required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated
            data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after
            you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you
            personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information
            shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to
            erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data
            portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention
            period.

          <h4>Information Security</h4>
          <p>
            We secure information you provide on computer servers in a
            controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access,
            use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative,
            technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against
            unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal
            Information in its control and custody. However, no data
            transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be
            guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal
            Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy
            limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the
            security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data
            exchanged between you and our Website cannot be guaranteed; and
            (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with
            in transit by a third-party, despite best efforts.

          <h4>Changes and Amendments</h4>
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in our
            discretion and will notify you of any material changes to the way in
            which we treat Personal Information. When changes are made, we will
            revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We may also
            provide notice to you in other ways in our discretion, such as
            through contact information you have provided. Any updated version
            of this Privacy Policy will be effective immediately upon the
            posting of the revised Privacy Policy unless otherwise specified.
            Your continued use of the Website or Services after the effective
            date of the revised Privacy Policy (or such other act specified at
            that time) will constitute your consent to those changes. However,
            we will not, without your consent, use your Personal Data in a
            manner materially different than what was stated at the time your
            Personal Data was collected.
